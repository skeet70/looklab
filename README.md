# looklab

A tool, and eventually a web app, for **measuring camera "looks" (film simulations, picture profiles, LUTs) rigorously, and telling you how to reproduce a target look on your own camera**.

- Build a **target look** from RAW+JPEG pairs attested to use a given sim. Data can come from one camera or be crowdsourced from many, so the look is separated from any single sensor.
- **Compare** any two looks in a perceptual appearance space (CAM16-UCS), broken down into tone, neutral tint, chroma, hue and lightness components, with uncertainty.
- **Match** a look on another body. You get either the best in-camera settings for stock firmware, or an exact LUT/curve bundle for firmware that can load one.

## Design docs

Read in order. Each doc is self-contained enough to hand to an implementer.
